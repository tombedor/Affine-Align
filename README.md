Afine Align
=======

Given a training set and test of paired sequences, computes sequence alignments. 

The implementation uses an affine gap penalty model. A grid of gap initiation and gap extension penalty values are tested and evaluated against a given 'correct' alignment.

A test set of alignments are then computed.

This is the first program I wrote in Java, and has its cringe-worthy elements to it. But it works.
